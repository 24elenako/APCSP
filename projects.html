    <h2>The iSearch</h2>
    <img class="image" src = "https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&ik=0a26f87c84&attid=0.1&permmsgid=msg-a:r-4788609342647367489&th=180fbea450ec68ac&view=att&disp=safe&realattid=f_l3lrk60o0">
    <p class="p">This is the first page of my isearch project that I did freshman year. It was the main project for my English class, and it is a series of essays and an interview that gives the reader information on the topic. This project required a lot of research and writing, but I honestly enjoyed it, since writing is my strength. Since I had to complete this project online, it taught me a lot about time management, and it taught me a lot about how different pieces of writing differ. </p>

    <h2>The Fermentation Project</h2>
      <img class="image" src = "https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&ik=0a26f87c84&attid=0.1&permmsgid=msg-a:r-7797554315176184231&th=180fbf77ab6612c3&view=att&disp=safe&realattid=f_l3ls2qof0">
      <p class="p">I also did this project my freshman year. It was for my biology class, and I had to demonstrate how fermnentation works while making sourdough bread, as the process of making sourdough bread requires the starter to ferment. Completing the project required lots of research and hands on work, like making the dough. This project taught me a lot about fermentation and time management as well, as I was in online school while doing this, so I had to manage my time and make sure I got the process complete on time.</p>
